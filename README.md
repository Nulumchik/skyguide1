SkyGuide — No-registration build with chat
=========================================

This package preserves your original site design and removes registration.
Chat is added as a floating widget with automatic guest names.

How to run locally:
1. cd server
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. Open http://localhost:3000

Notes:
- Messages are stored in server/messages.json
- No registration or login is required; users get automatic guest names.
- To push to GitHub, upload the whole folder. The server is a simple Node project.
